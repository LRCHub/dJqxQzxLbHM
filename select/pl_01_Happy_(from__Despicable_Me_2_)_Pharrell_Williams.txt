It might seem crazy
what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here
you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon
that could go to space
With the air like I don't care
baby by the way
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
that's what you wanna do
Here comes bad news
talking this and that, yeah!
Well gimme all you got and
don't hold back, yeah!
Well I should probably warn you
I'll be just fine, yeah!
No offense to you,
don't waste your time,
here's why!
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
that's what you wanna do
(Happy!) Bring me down,
can't nothing
(Happy!) Bring me down,
my levels too high
(Happy!) To bring me down,
can't nothing
(Happy!) Bring me down, I said
Bring me down, can't nothing
Bring me down,
my levels too high
To bring me down, can't nothing
Bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
that's what you wanna do
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
that's what you wanna do
Bring me down, can't nothing
Bring me down,
my levels too high
To bring me down, can't nothing
Bring me down, I said
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like
happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know
